I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best-and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switced careers, working as a software Engineer at VR startup. "</p>

                    <p>"Before joining the bootcamp, I've written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theors who can only say wonderful things happen about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example og my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a fullstack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommended!."</p>
